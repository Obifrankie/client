# client

This is the same code for softwareDining Web or client.

I added a circleci config file to run contionious integration.

The script has 3 jobs 
- build
- test
- analyze

SoftwareDining was built using the MERN stack and the main frontend and backend is located in my github.

This is just for CI testing purposes
